After providing your explanation, you must not answer the question. You must rate the question complexity by strictly following the scale: {\", \".join(difficulty)}. You must return the complexity by strictly following this format: \"[[complexity]]\", for example: \"Complexity: [[middle_school]]\".'\n",
